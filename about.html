    <h1>Hello! This is my first Web page.</h1>
    <p>
        Well there's nothing special to put here. I'm just a student who enjoys learning new things.<br>
        The reason I choosed to learn Web Developement at Go My Code is that I've always wanted to creat <br>
        my own Web page and this needs a lot of time to learn and it needs a lot of practice and patience.<br>
